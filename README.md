## **About Macbook keyboard with html/css/js**

This codebase is the result of a "challenge" proposed to me by my web dev friend Eleandro Duzentos on linkedin. Eleandro Duzentos created
a macbook keyboard using flutter, and suggested me to do a web version of what he did.

## **The following image is a screenshot of the mac keyboard created by Eleandro using flutter
