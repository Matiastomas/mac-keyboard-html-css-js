# **Macbook Keyboard With html/css/js**

## **About 

This codebase is the result of a "challenge"/(suggestion) proposed to me by my web dev friend Eleandro Duzentos on linkedin. Eleandro Duzentos created
a macbook keyboard using flutter, and suggested me to do a web version of what he did.

### **The following image is a screenshot of the mac keyboard created by Eleandro using flutter**
